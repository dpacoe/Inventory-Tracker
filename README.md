# Inventory-Tracker
This program is designed to assist owners of small businesses with important tasks like managing customer databases, adding debt and balance, and managing inventory.

## Installation
In general, I prefer to include a little setup file that basically creates an alias in your bash_profiles section.
1. Download the entire folder to applications
2. In terminal, type in "python ~/Applications/Inventory-Tracker/setup.py" and press enter.
The setup program will open up your bash profile and put a line in that says that when you type "inventorytracker" into the shell, you are running the inventorytracker program.
3. The program is now installed

### How to use
When you want to use the program, open up a terminal window and then type "inventorytracker" YOU WONT BE ABLE TO USE THE PROGRAM IF YOU HAVE NOT INSTALLED IT PROPERLY.
